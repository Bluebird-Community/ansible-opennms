# ðŸš€ Deployment of OpenNMS with Ansible âœ¨

Encoding your infrastructure using Ansible is widely adopted.
This repository provides the roles to deploy OpenNMS Horizon components such as:

* OpenNMS Horizon core system
* OpenNMS Minion for monitoring isolated network segments
* OpenNMS Sentinel for scaling workloads in the storage backend

## ðŸŽ¯ Scope

* Gives users the possibility to deploy the components following best-practices
* Ubuntu LTS is the base OS for now
* Given the current contribution and resources, adding OS variants is not in scope for now.
We are open and welcome constructive contribution.

## ðŸ—º Design principle
* Only allow configuration of system configuration files which can't be modified from the web user interface or external API's
* function > variation, better having one happy with Ubuntu as a base OS, than 5 unhappy with support for 5 other operating systems
